# Docker Compose -
- Docker Compose is a tool that helps you run multiple Docker containers together as one application.
- Instead of starting each container manually, you can define everything in one file (docker-compose.yml) and start them all with a single command.
- Docker Compose file (docker-compose.yml) is a YAML file where you define the services, networks, and volumes for your multi-container Docker application.
- It tells Docker Compose how to build and run your application with all its components.
