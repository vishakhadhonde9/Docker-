# Docker Volume -
-  Docker volume is a persistent storage mechanism used by Docker containers to store and share data between containers or with the host system.
-  Volumes allow data to persist even when containers are stopped, removed, or recreated, and they are managed by Docker itself.
-  Docker volumes are stored outside of the container's filesystem(VM), which ensures data persists even if the container is removed.
-  Volumes can also be shared between multiple containers.
