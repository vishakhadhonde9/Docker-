# Containerization - 
- Containerization is a software deployment process that bundles an application’s code with all the files and libraries it needs to run on any infrastructure.
- Traditionally, to run any application on your computer, you had to install the version that matched your machine’s operating system.
- Containerization is a technology that allows you to package an application and its dependencies (like libraries, frameworks, and configuration files) into a single lightweight, portable unit called a container.
- Containers can run consistently across different environments, such as a developer's laptop, testing servers, or production systems.
