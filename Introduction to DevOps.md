# Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) -
- The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used by software developers and organizations to design, develop, test, and deploy software applications efficiently and systematically.
- It outlines the steps necessary to produce high-quality software that meets customer expectations, is delivered on time, and is cost-effective.

- 1. Requirement Analysis -
  - Gather and analyze the requirements from stakeholders.
  - Define the project's scope, objectives, and deliverables.

- 2. Planning -
  - Develop a project plan, including timelines, resources, and budgets.
  - Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies.

- 3. System Design -
  - Define the architecture, components, interfaces, and data flows.
  - Create detailed design documents to guide developers.

- 4. Development -
  - Write and build the actual code based on design documents.
  - Use programming languages, frameworks, and tools suited for the project.

- 5. Testing -
  - Verify that the software meets the requirements and is free of defects.
  - Perform unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.

- 6. Deployment -
  - Release the software to the production environment.
  - Ensure proper configuration and monitor for any deployment issues

- 7. Maintenance -
  - Provide ongoing support, fix bugs, and update the software as needed.
  - Monitor performance and adapt to changing requirements or environments.



# SDLC Model -
# 1.Waterfall Model -
- The Waterfall Model is one of the earliest and most straightforward Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) models.
- It follows a linear and sequential approach, where each phase must be completed before the next phase begins.
- There is no overlapping of phases.

# 2.Spiral Model -
- The Spiral Model is an SDLC model that combines iterative development with risk management.
- It is suitable for complex and high-risk projects, as it emphasizes identifying and mitigating risks at every stage of the development process.
- The model is represented as a spiral with several loops.
- Each loop corresponds to a development phase, and the project grows progressively.

# 3.V-Model (Verification and Validation) -
- The V-Model (Verification and Validation model) is an SDLC model that emphasizes testing at every stage of development.
- It is an extension of the Waterfall Model, with a strong focus on quality by mapping each development phase to a corresponding testing phase.
